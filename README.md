# Scrappy.NET - The C# Rewrite of Scrappy Bot

> A modern, fully rewritten version of the original scrappy-bot  
> Developed by [@YP501](https://github.com/YP501)

Scrappy.NET is a complete C#/.NET rewrite of the [original](https://github.com/YP501/scrappy-bot) JavaScript-based bot.
This version is supposed to be cleaner, more modular, easier to self-host, and designed to be adaptable for more servers than just the FrankieFms Lounge.

More will come here when I release the first version!
